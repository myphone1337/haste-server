# Haste

Haste is an open-source pastebin software.  This is a port of the original
software, hacked so it can run on [Cozy Cloud](https://cozy.io), the Personal
Platform as a service.

## Basic Usage

Type what you want me to see, click "Save", and then copy the public URL.  Send
that URL to someone and they'll see what you see.

To make a new entry, click "New" (or type 'control + n')

To easily retrieve your entries, you can name them by entering a title in the
left column.  You can also chose the time each entry will be kept.

This version of Haste allow to share files.  You can drag’n’drop a file or
select it with the button on the left.
